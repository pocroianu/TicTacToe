## What it is?
It's a boilerplate to show how to use PIXI.js with Typescript (& Yarn).
Feel free to use it for your own PIXI.js projects.

## Getting started with Typescript & PIXI.js

**Install & build**  
- **`yarn`** - Install dependencies
- **`yarn build`** - Build once
- **`yarn build:watch`** - Build and watch files

**Now open the public/index.html in browser!**
